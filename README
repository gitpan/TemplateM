ABSTRACT
    The TemplateM module means for text templates processing in XML, HTML,
    TEXT and so on formats. TemplateM is the alternative to most of standard
    modules, and it can accomplish remote access to template files, has
    simple syntax, small size and flexibility. Then you use TemplateM,
    functionality and data are completely separated, this is quality of
    up-to-date web-projects.

TERMS
  Scheme
    Set of methods prodiving process template's structures.

  Template
    File or array of data which represents the set of instructions,
    directives and tags of markup languages and statistics.

  Directive
    Name of structure in a template for substitution. There are a number of
    directives:

        cgi, val, do, loop, if, endif, else, endelse

  Structure
    Structure is the tag or the group of tags in a template which defining a
    scope of substitution. The structure consist of tag <!-- --> and
    formatted content:

        DIRECTIVE: LABEL

    The structure can be simple or complex. Simple one is like this:

        <!-- cgi: foo -->
        or
        <!-- val: bar -->

    Complex structure is the group of simple structures which constitutive a
    "section"

        <!-- do: foo -->
        ...
            <!-- val: bar -->
        ...
        <!-- loop: foo -->

        even so:

        <!-- if: foo -->
        ...
        <!-- endif: foo -->
        <!-- else: foo -->
        ...
        <!-- endelse: foo -->

  Label
    This is identifier of structure. E.g. foo, bar, baz

        <!-- cgi: foo -->

DESCRIPTION
  SCHEMES
    While defining use it can specify 2 accessible schemes - galore or
    default. It is not obligatory to point at default scheme.

    Default scheme is basic and defines using of basic methods:

    "cast, cast_if, cast_loop, finalize and html"

    Default scheme methods is expedient for small-datasize projects.

    Galore scheme is the alternative for base scheme and it defines own set
    of methods:

    "stash, start, loop, finish, ifelse, output and html"

    In order to get knowing which of schemes is activated you need to invoke
    methods either module() or scheme()

        my $module = $template->module;
        my $module = $template->scheme;

    In order to get know real module name of the used scheme it's enough to
    read property 'module' of $template object

        my $module = $template->{module};

  CONSTRUCTOR
    Constructor new() is the principal method independent of selected
    scheme. Almost simple way to use the constructor is:

        my $template = new TemplateM( -template => "blah-blah-blah" );

    This invoking takes directive to use simple text as template.

    Below is the attribute list of constructor:

    asfile  Asfile flag designates either path or filehandle to file is
            passed for reading from disk, bypassing the method of remote
            obtaining of a template.

    cache   Cache is the absolute or relative path to directory for cache
            files storage. This directory needs to have a permission to read
            and write files. When cache is missed caching is disabled.
            Caching on is recommended for faster module operations.

    file    Template filename is the filename, opened filehandler (GLOB) or
            locations of a template. Supports relative or absolute pathes,
            and also template file locator. Relative path can forestall with
            ./ prefix or without it. Absolute path must be forestall with /
            prefix. Template file locator is the URI formatted string. If
            the file is missed, it use ``index.shtml' from current directory
            as default value.

    header  HTTP header uses as value by default before main content
            template print (method html).

                my $template = new TemplateM( -header => "Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n\n");
                print $template->html;

    login and password
            User Login and user password are data for standard
            HTTP-authorization. Login and password will be used when the
            template defined via locator and when remote access is protected
            by HTTP-authorization of remote server. When user_login is
            missed the access to remote template file realizes simplified
            scheme, without basic HTTP-authorization.

    method  Request method points to method of remote HTTP/HTTPS access to
            template page. Can take values: "GET", "HEAD", "PUT" or "POST".
            HEAD methods can be used only for headers getting.

    onutf8 or utf8
            onutf8 flag turn UTF8 mode for access to a file. The flag allow
            to get rid of a forced setting utf-8 flag for properties
            template and work by method Encode::_utf8_on()

    template
            HTTP content (template). This attribute has to be defined when
            template content is not able to get from a file or get it from
            remote locations. E.g. it has to be defined when a template
            selects from a database. Defining of this attribute means
            disabling of precompile result caching!

    timeout Timeout is the period of cache file keeping in integer seconds.
            When the value is missed cache file "compiles" once and will be
            used as template. Positive value has an effect only then
            template file is dynamic and it changes in time. Previous
            versions of the module sets value 20 instead 0 by default. It
            had to set the value -1 for "compilation" disabling. For current
            version of the module value can be 0 or every positive number. 0
            is equivalent -1 of previous versions of the module.

    reqcode Request code is the pointer to the subroutine must be invoked
            for HTTP::Request object after creation via method new.

            Sample:

                -reqcode => sub { 
                    my $req = shift;
                    ...
                    $req-> ...
                    ...
                    return 1;
                }

    rescode Response code is the pointer to the subroutine must be invoked
            for HTTP::Response after creation via calling
            $ua->request($req).

            Sample:

                -rescode => sub { 
                    my $res = shift;
                    ...
                    $res-> ...
                    ...
                    return 1;
                }

    uacode  UserAgent code is the pointer to the subroutine must be invoked
            for LWP::UserAgent after creation via method new().

            Sample:

                -uacode => sub { 
                    my $ua = shift;
                    ...
                    $ua-> ...
                    ...
                    return 1;
                }

    uaopts  UserAgent options is the pointer to the hash containing options
            for defining parameters of UserAgent object's constructor. (See
            LWP::UserAgent)

            Example:

                -uaopts => {
                    agent                 => "Mozilla/4.0",
                    max_redirect          => 10,
                    requests_redirectable => ['GET','HEAD','POST'],
                    protocols_allowed     => ['http', 'https'], # Required Crypt::SSLeay
                    cookie_jar            => new HTTP::Cookies(
                            file     => File::Spec->catfile("/foo/bar/_cookies.dat"),
                            autosave => 1 
                        ),
                    conn_cache            => new LWP::ConnCache(),
                }

  DEFAULT SCHEME METHODS (BASIC METHODS)
    It is enough to define the module without parameters for using of basic
    methods.

        use TemplateM;

    After that only basic metods will be automatically enabled.

   cast
    Modification of labels (cgi labels)

        $template->cast({label1=>value1, label2=>value2, ... });

    label   Label - name will be replaced with appropriate value in tag <!--
            cgi: label -->

    value   Value - Value, which CGI-script sets. Member of the label
            manpage

   cast_loop
    Block labels modification (val labels)

        $template->cast_loop (block_label, {label1=>value1, label2=>value2, ... }]);

    block_label
            Block label - Block identification name. The name will be
            inserted in tags <!-- do: block_label --> and <!-- loop:
            block_label --> - all content between this tags processes like
            labels, but the tag will be formed as <!-- val: label -->

   finalize
    Block finalizing

        $template->finalize(block_label);

    Block finalizing uses for not-processed blocks deleting. You need use
    finalizing every time you use blockes.

   cast_if
        $template->cast_if(ifblock_label, predicate);

    Method analyses boolean value of predicate. If value is true, the method
    prints if-structure content only.

        <!-- if: label -->
            ... blah blah blah ...
        <!-- end_if: label -->

    otherwise the method prints else-structure content only.

        <!-- else: label -->
            ... blah blah blah ...
        <!-- end_else: label -->

   html
    Template finalizing

        print $template->html(-header=>HTTP_header);
        print $template->html(HTTP_header);
        print $template->html;

    The procedure will return formed document after template processing. if
    header is present as argument it will be added at the beginning of
    template's return.

  GALORE SCHEME METHODS
    It is enough to define the module with parameter 'galore' for using of
    galore scheme methods.

        use TemplateM 'galore';

   stash
    stash (or cast) method is the function of import variables value into
    template.

        $template->stash(title => 'PI' , pi => 3.1415926);

    This example demonstrate how all of <!-- cgi: title --> and <!-- cgi: pi
    --> structures will be replaced by parameters of stash method invoking.

    In contrast to default scheme, in galore scheme stash method process
    directives <!-- cgi: label --> only with defined labels when invoking,
    whereas cast method of default scheme precess all of directives <!--
    cgi: label --> in template!

   start and finish
    Start method defines the beginning of loop, and finish method defines
    the end. Start method returns reference to the subtemplate object, that
    is all between do and loop directives.

        <!-- do: block_label -->
            ... blah blah blah ...
                <!-- val: label1 -->
                <!-- val: label2 -->
                <!-- cgi: label -->
            ... blah blah blah ...
        <!-- loop: block_label -->

        my $block = $template->start(block_label);
        ...
        $block->finish;

    For acces to val directives it is necessary to use loop method, and for
    access to cgi directives use stash method.

   loop
    The method takes as parameters a hash of arguments or a reference to
    this hash.

        $block->loop(label1 => 'A', label2 => 'B');
        $block->loop({label1 => 'A', label2 => 'B'});

    Stash method also can be invoked in $block object context.

        $block->stash(label => 3.1415926);

   ifelse
        $template->ifelse("ifblock_label", $predicate)
        $block->ifelse("ifblock_label", $predicate)

    Method is equal to cast_if method of default scheme. The difference,
    ifelse method can be processed with $template or $block, whereas cast_if
    method has deal with $template object.

   output
    The method returns result of template processing. Output method has deal
    with $template and $block object:

        $block->output;
        $template->output;

   html
    The method is completely equal to html method of default scheme.

  EXAMPLE
    In test.pl file:

        use TemplateM 3.01 'galore';

        my $tpl = new TemplateM(
            -file   => 'test.tpl',
            -asfile => 1,
        );

        $tpl->stash(
            module  => (split(/\=/,"$tpl"))[0],
            version => $tpl->VERSION,
            scheme  => $tpl->scheme()." / ".$tpl->{module},
            date    => scalar(localtime(time())),
        );

        my $row_box = $tpl->start('row');
        foreach my $row ('A'..'F') {
            $row_box->loop({});
            my $col_box = $row_box->start('col');
            foreach my $col (1...6) {
                $col_box->loop( foo  => $row.$col );
                $col_box->cast_if(div=>(
                        ('A'..'F')[$col-1] ne $row
                        &&
                        ('A'..'F')[6-$col] ne $row
                    ));
            }
            $col_box->finish;
        }
        $row_box->finish;

        binmode STDOUT, ':raw';
        print $tpl->output();

    In test.tpl file:
